- Access Token: Used temporarily to authenticate your session with our backend servers.

We also generate and store:
- Game Data: Drawings, guesses, scores, and match history.

5. DATA SECURITY
We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
